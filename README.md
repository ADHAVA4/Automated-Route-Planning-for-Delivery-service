# Automated-Route-Planning-for-Delivery-services
 This project provides an automated solution for route planning in delivery services. It utilizes graph theory algorithms, specifically Dijkstra's algorithm, to optimize delivery routes for multiple vehicles while considering factors such as distance, vehicle capacity, and delivery location demands.

Key Features:

<li>Efficient route optimization using Dijkstra's algorithm and backtracking
<li>Support for multiple vehicles with customizable capacities.
<li>Handling of delivery locations with varying demands.
<li>Visualization of optimized routes on an interactive map using Folium.

  How to Use:

<li>Prepare delivery location data in CSV format, including coordinates and demand.
<li>Define vehicle specifications, such as capacity and starting location.
<li>Run the provided Python script to generate optimized routes.
<li>View the results, including route details and visualizations.

  Dependencies:

<li>Python 3.x
<li>geopy (for geodesic distance calculations)
<li>folium (for route visualization on maps)
